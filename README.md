Interactive notification pop-over (aka "Toast) modeled after the iOS AirPods and Apple Pencil indicator.

## Installation

> The recommended way is to use SPM.

### SPM

Add this repository to your package list: `git@github.com:pkluz/Indicate.git`

### CocoaPods

To install Indicate for Swift 5.0+, include the following in your Podfile

```ruby
pod 'IndicateKit', '~> 2.0.0'
```

### Carthage

To integrate Indicate into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "pkluz/Indicate" ~> 2.0.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the resulting `Indicate.framework` into your Xcode project.

## How To

After adding the framework to your project, you need to import the module
```swift
import Indicate
```

Afterwards presenting an indicator is a three-step process.

1. Define the content.
2. Configure the presentation.
3. Present the indicator on any view.

Here's an example:

```swift
// STEP 1: Define the content
let content = Indicate.Content(title: .init(value: "Hello World", alignment: .natural),
                               subtitle: .init(value: "Indicate", alignment: .natural),
                               attachment: .emoji(.init(value: "ðŸŒ¼", alignment: .natural)))

// STEP 2: Configure the presentation
let config = Indicate.Configuration()
    .with(tap: { controller in
        controller.dismiss()
    })

// STEP 3: Present the indicator
let controller = Indicate.PresentationController(content: content, configuration: config)
controller.present(in: view)
```
